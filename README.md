Short Introduction

Greetings,

My name is Saquib Sarkar. I am a senior Computer Science major at Bradley University, and I will be graduating this semester. My favorite subjects are math, literature, and history. My favorite hobbies is to watch/play soccer, ride my bike or rollerblade, read books, and learn more about new technology and world history & culture. I'm excited to be here and I hope to learn a lot from this class. I hope to find ajob and work at a good company in the near future. I looking forward to learning more from CIS 430!

Sincerely,
Saquib Sarkar
